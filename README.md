Nutrition_App
=============

                                        Design documentation of the multimodal application

Project description:

This a simple application which makes users aware of what is going into their system when they eat particular kind of food. The specialty of this application is that it provides visual aids in form of images for user to choose the food item even if he or she doesn’t know to type the item.

The application reads out the nutrition content of the food item and also displays the textual and image information about the food parallelly.

Users can use the system in two ways, either by voice commands or by simple button clicks. Or even asynchronously switch between voice and button clicks.

Since the user needs to know when the system is hearing to his/her commands, a voice button is provided, which when clicked will start recording the command.

User can exit the application with simple exit button or speaking exit. Also user can get help on application usage by clicking help or by just saying help.

Tools Used:

•	Development Platform – Android

•	IDE – Eclipse

•	Java SDK – 2.3

•	Speech recognition and synthesis tools – Nuance speech kit

Since the application has to communicate to remote voice servers or nuance, user needs to be connected to internet.
